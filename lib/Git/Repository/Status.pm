Git::Repository::Status - git repository status information as Perl module

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # load the Status plugin
    use Git::Repository 'Status';

    # get the status of all files
    my @status = Git::Repository->new->status('--ignored');

    # print all tracked files
    for (@status) {
        say $_->path1 if $_->tracked;
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Instances of L<Git::Repository::Status> represent a path in a git working
tree with its status. The constructor should not be called directly but
by calling the C<status> method of L<Git::Repository>, provided by
L<Git::Repository::Plugin::Status>.
